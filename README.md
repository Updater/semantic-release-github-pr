This [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) plugin will post a Github PR comment with a preview of the release that would result from merging.

## Install
```bash
npm install -D semantic-release-github-pr
```

## Configuration
This plugin is a complement to `semantic-release`. It is assumed the user is already fully familiar with that package and its workflow.

### Github
Github authentication must be configured for `semantic-relase`.

* [README for `semantic-release`'s Github plugin](https://github.com/semantic-release/github/#github-repository-authentication)

## Usage
The easiest way to use the plugin is through the CLI. If more flexibility is needed, the plugin can also be set through the `semantic-release` config in `package.json`.

### CLI
Post a comment to any open Github PRs with a matching base branch and git head. Previous comments generated by this plugin will be removed.
```bash
npx semantic-release-github-pr
```

The `semantic-release-github-pr` command is provided as a convenience. Internally, it simply wraps the `semantic-release` command, using the necessary plugins hooks (see config below). Otherwise, it works just the same and accepts [the same options](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#cli) .

### `package.json` config
If more flexibility is needed, the plugins can be configured manually. This package provides [`verifyConditions`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#verifyconditions) (deletes old comments) and [`publish`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#publish) (creates new commens) plugins.

Default configuration (as encapsulated in [the `semantic-release-github-pr` command](https://github.com/Updater/semantic-release-github-pr/blob/master/bin/semantic-release-github-pr.js)):
```json
{
  "release": {
    "publish": "semantic-release-github-pr",
    "verifyConditions": ["@semantic-release/github", "semantic-release-github-pr"]
  }
}
```

## CI
This plugin is best used with a CI build process to fully automate the posting of comments in Github PRs. Ideally, it should run whenever a relevant PR is opened.

### Travis
By default, Travis will trigger a build whenever a PR is opened (pr) or updated (push) in the corresponding Github repo. 

```yaml
after_success:
  - "npx semantic-release-github-pr"
```

### CircleCI
Unfortunately, CircleCI only supports building on push, [not when a PR is created](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/trigger-new-build-on-pr/4219). This limits the usefulness of the plugin somewhat, as a build will have to be triggered manually after a PR is opened.

```yaml
test:
  post:
    - "npx semantic-release-github-pr"
```
